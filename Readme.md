## TEA

A MATLAB toolbox for electrophysiological analysis



### Structure

The toolbox contains several matlab classes with functions to do common electrophysiology-related analysis. 

#### Class Ephys

Ephys-analysis function based on a single neuron's response to a single stimulus (bird song). It is based on three basal classes, Sound, Spike, Trigger.

#### Class Neuron

Ephys-analysis function based on a single neuron's response to all stimuli.

#### Class Batch

Ephys-analysis function based on all neuron's response to all stimuli

#### Class segment

contain multiple functions to segment a birdsong into syllables

#### Class draw

draw spectrogram, raster plot, spike density function (sdf), peristimulus time histogram (psth), etc.

#### Class extract

A utilus class contain several functions to "extract" specific information

#### Class Stimuli

To generate stimuli based on raw birdsongs (e.g. normalization, segmentation into single syllables/notes)



##### ... under construction
